    Args:
        prompt:
            The prompt to generate a response to.
        model:
            The model to use for generation.
        temperature:
            The temperature to use for generation.
        max_tokens:
            The maximum number of tokens to generate.
        response_format (optional):
            The model to use for generation. If None then the response is returned as a
            string. Defaults to None.
        validation_fn (optional):
            A function that validates the response. Defaults to no validation.

    Returns:
        The generated response, which is a Pydantic model if `response_format` is set,
        and otherwise a string.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError:
            If the model failed to generate a response that fit the response format.
            This is only relevant if there is some post-initialisation validation
            happening in the response format.
